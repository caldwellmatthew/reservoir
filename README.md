# Reservoir Library
2 libraries for creating reservoirs with included samples and tests. Each library is a different implementation of a generic reservoir class. The main difference between the 2 is the internal math the inputs given to the reservoir. Both reservoirs give similar outputs however.
# Reservoir1 Folder
A generic library for creating, training, and using reservoir systems adapted from Jack Canaday's reservoir code.
Includes commands to implement, train, propagate, reset, and export a reservoir.
A sample implementation and a pytest unit test file are included.
# Reservoir2 Folder
A generic library for creating, training, and using reservoir systems.
# Reservoir Graphing Folder
Includes programs that create pretty pictures that show the theoretical structure of a reservoir.
