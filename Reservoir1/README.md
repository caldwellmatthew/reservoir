# Reservoir.py
A generic library for creating, training, and using reservoir systems.
Includes commands to implement, train, propagate, reset, and export a reservoir.
# ReservoirSinWaveSample.py
A sample program that uses Reservoir.py to implement and train a reservoir.
Creates a small reservoir, trains it to create a sin wave, then outputs that sin wave.
The shapes of the Numpy arrays are important for Reservoir.py, so pay attention to those.
# test_reservoir.py
A unit test program for Reservoir.py used to test different functions.
